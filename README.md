# Dataset Analysis and Visualization with Pandas & Matplotlib

## 🎯 Objective
This project demonstrates:
- Loading and exploring a dataset using **pandas**.
- Performing basic data analysis and descriptive statistics.
- Creating simple yet insightful plots with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.
- Summarizing findings and observations.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The **Iris dataset** (a classic dataset for classification and statistical analysis) is used here.  
It contains measurements of **sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width** for 150 iris flowers across three species:
- Setosa  
- Versicolor  
- Virginica  

The dataset is loaded directly using `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`.
